![Enable Customer Tag Restriction](https://placehold.co/600x300?text=Enable+Customer+Tag+Restriction)

Turn on **Customer tag based restriction** and enter the tag you want to allow testing for.  
Only customers with this tag will see Ziovy’s rewards features.

---

### 3. Add the tag to your test customer  

![Add Tag to Customer](https://placehold.co/600x300?text=Add+Customer+Tag)

Go to your **Customer Profile** in Shopify (or your platform) and add the tag you specified.  
This ensures only test customers get access.

### 4. Place a test order and try Ziovy

Now place an order on your store using your tagged test customer.  
You’ll see Ziovy rewards, points, and coupon generation in action without exposing it to everyone.
